WE HAVE A CONCEPT CALLED ARRAY DESTRUCTURING IN JAVASCRIPT !! 
WHERE IN WE CAN ASSIGN MULTIPLE VALUES TO MULTIPLE VARIABLES 
AT ONCE ! 
EVEN IN PYTHON WE CAN DO IT USING :-
a , b , c = 10 , 20 , 30 
BUT THIS IS NOT ARRAY DESTRUCTURING !! 
SO THE CORRESPONDING VARIABLES BE ASSIGNED TO THE CORRESPONDING VALUESS !! 

IN JAVASCRIPT WE DO IT USING ARRAY DESTRUCTURING !! 

let [a,b,c] = [1,2,3] 
WE SEE SIMILAR TYPES ON BOTH SIDES !! THE ARRAY TYPE 
JUST ASSIGN THE ELEMENTS POSITION WISE !! a = 1 , b = 2 , c = 3 

// ARRAY DESTRUCTURING EXAMPLE !! 
let [ a , b , c ] = [ 10 , 20 , 30 ] 

console.log ( " A : " , a ) ;
console.log ( " B : " , b ) ;
console.log ( " C : " , c ) ;

/* 
       THE PREVIOUS THING IS EQUIVALENT TO
       let a = 10 ; 
       let b = 20 ;
       let c = 30 ; 
       
       WE CAN ALSO USE ARRAY DESTRUCTURING TO SWAP TWO VALUES 
       WHICH OTHERWISE WE DO USING :- 
       let temp = a ; 
       a = b ; 
       b = temp ; 

       [a,b] = [b,a] 
*/

let first = 10 ;
let second = 20 ; 

let printValues = ( a , b ) => console.log ( "A : " + a + " B : " + b )  ; 

printValues( first , second ) ; 

[ first , second ] = [ second , first ] ; // SWAP VALUES 

printValues( first , second ) ; 

/* 
       THIS WAS AN EXAMPLE OF ARRAY DESTRUCTURING !! 
       HOWEVER BUILDING REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS WE ENCOUNTER OBJECT MORE
       THAN ANYTHING ELSE, 
       SO A YET ANOTHER CONCEPT THAT COMES INTO PICTURE IS :-
              "Property Shorthand" 

*/

let [ name , branch ] = [ "ABHISHEK RAI" , "CSE FIFTH SEM" ] ;
// ABOVE IS ARRAY DESTRUCTURING !! 

let student = { name , branch } ; 

console.log ( student.name ) ; 

/*  
SHORTHAND METHOD NAMES ARE ALSO COMMON THESE DAYS IN ECMA6
WHERE IN THE PROPERTIES RELATED TO OBJECTS CAN BE ASSIGNED TO 
THE OBJECTS IN THEIR DEFINITION !! 
*/ 

// First Way 
let helloWorld = {
       a : 10 , 
       b : 20 , 
       printHelloWorld() {
              console.log ( "HELLO WORLD !! " ) ; 
       }
}

// Second Way 
let helloWorld2 = {
       a : 100 , 
       b : 200 , 
       printHelloWorld : function( a , b ) {
              console.log ( "HELLO WORLD !! " ) ; 
       }
}

// Third Way !! 
let helloWorld3 = {
       a : 10 , 
       b : 100 , 
       printHelloWorld : () => console.log ( "HELLO WORLD !! " ) 
}
