In JavaScript,  true  and  false  are a little bit tricky. In most languages, the boolean
values  true  and  false  represent the true/false results. In JavaScript, a string such
as  Packt  evaluates to  true .


Template literals
Template literals are a nice functionality because we can create strings without
the need to concatenate the values.
For example, consider the following examples written with ES5:
const book = { 
 name: 'Learning JavaScript DataStructures and Algorithms' 
}; 
console.log('You are reading ' + book.name + '.,\n and this is a new line\n and so is this.'
We can improve the syntax of the previous  console.log  output with the following
code:
console.log(`You are reading ${book.name}., 
 and this is a new line 
 and so is this.`); 
Template literals are enclosed by backticks ( ` ). To interpolate a variable value,
we will simply set the variable value inside a dollar sign and curly braces ( ${} ),
as we did with  book.name .
Template literals can also be used for multiline strings. There is no need to use  \n
anymore. Simply hit Enter on the keyboard to take the string to a new line, as
was done with  and this is a new line  in the previous example.
This functionality will be very useful in our examples to simplify the output!
